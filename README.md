# Industry 4.1

## Objective:
To develop an automated industrial monitoring system that enables real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance using a combination of sensors, cameras, and IoT technologies.

## Motivation:
Industrial sectors in India experience unexpected shutdowns due to issues like:
Power fluctuations
Machinery failure
Poor maintenance
These shutdowns lead to major financial losses. Hence, there's a need for a system that can predict and prevent equipment failures.

## Proposed Solution:
A smart automation system termed "Industry 4.1" that:
Integrates sensors (voltage, current, gas, vibration)
Uses cameras for object detection
Relies on IoT and Machine Learning for predictive maintenance
Provides remote accessibility of data 24/7 via the internet

## Key Features:
Machine Health Monitoring
Energy Monitoring
Object Detection
Environmental Monitoring
Scalable Design for Large Industries
